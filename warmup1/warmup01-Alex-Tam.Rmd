#Euclidean distance

Definition

The **Euclidean distance** between points **p** and **q** is the length of the line segment connecting them (\overline{**p** **q**}).

In Cartesian coordinates, if **p**=(p<sub>1</sub>, p<sub>2</sub>,..., p<sub>n</sub>) and **q**=(q<sub>1</sub>, q<sub>2</sub>,..., q<sub>n</sub>) are two points in Euclidean *n*-space, then the distance (d) from **p** to **q**, or from **q** to **p** is given by the Pythagorean formula:

\[d(\textbf{p},\textbf{q})=d(\textbf{q},\textbf{p})=\sqrt{(q_1-p_1)^2+(q_2-p_2)^2+...+(q_n-p_n)^2}\]

\[=\sqrt{\displaystyle\sum_{i=1}^{n}(q_i-p_i)^2}.\]

The position of a point in a Euclidean *n*-space is a Euclidean vector. So, **p** and **q** may be represented as Euclidean vectors, starting from the origin of the space (initial point) with their tips (terminal points) ending at the two points. The **Euclidean norm**, or **Euclidean length**, or **magnitude** of a vector measures the length of the vector:

\[\|p\|=\sqrt{p_1^2+p_2^2+...+p_n^2}=\sqrt{\textbf{p}.\textbf{p}},\]

where the last expression involves the dot product.
