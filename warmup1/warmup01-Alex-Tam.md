Euclidean distance
==================

Definition

The **Euclidean distance** between points **p** and **q** is the length of the line segment connecting them ().

In Cartesian coordinates, if **p**=(p<sub>1</sub>, p<sub>2</sub>,..., p<sub>n</sub>) and **q**=(q<sub>1</sub>, q<sub>2</sub>,..., q<sub>n</sub>) are two points in Euclidean *n*-space, then the distance (d) from **p** to **q**, or from **q** to **p** is given by the Pythagorean formula:

$$d(\\textbf{p},\\textbf{q})=d(\\textbf{q},\\textbf{p})=\\sqrt{(q\_1-p\_1)^2+(q\_2-p\_2)^2+...+(q\_n-p\_n)^2}$$

$$=\\sqrt{\\displaystyle\\sum\_{i=1}^{n}(q\_i-p\_i)^2}.$$

The position of a point in a Euclidean *n*-space is a Euclidean vector. So, **p** and **q** may be represented as Euclidean vectors, starting from the origin of the space (initial point) with their tips (terminal points) ending at the two points. The **Euclidean norm**, or **Euclidean length**, or **magnitude** of a vector measures the length of the vector:

$$\\|p\\|=\\sqrt{p\_1^2+p\_2^2+...+p\_n^2}=\\sqrt{\\textbf{p}.\\textbf{p}},$$

where the last expression involves the dot product.
