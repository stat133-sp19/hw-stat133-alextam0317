## Binomial

The package `"binomial_choose"` is a minimal implementation for simulating pick something with for given times and the number of success and the probability of success, and to visualize the relative frequencies in such a series of picking.


## Creating the times you want to pick

This is the number of success in n trials

```
bin_choose()
```
where n = trials, k = number of success


##next is to find the probability given the number of success, trials and the probability of success

```
bin_probability()
```
the function takes success, trials and prob


##the 'bin_distribution()' gives you a nice binomial distribution table

```
bin_distribution()
```


## Plot of probability

You can use the function `plot.bindis()` to create a graohic with the probability of a series of trials:

```{r, fig.show='hold'}
plot(bin_distribution(5,0.3))
```


##the 'bin_cumulative()' gives you a nice binomial distribution table with the cumulative probability column

```
bin_cumulative()
```

## Plot of cumulativeprobability

You can use the function `plot.bincum()` to create a graohic with the cumulative probability of a series of trials:

```{r, fig.show='hold'}
plot(bin_cumulative(5,0.3))
```


##printing a list with the number of trials and the probability

```{r}
bin1 <- bin_variable(trials = 10, p = 0.3)
bin1
```

##printing a summary list of the variable (including the number of trials, prob of success, mean, variance, mode, skewness and kurtosis)

```{r}
bin1 <- bin_variable(trials = 10, p = 0.3)
binsum1 <- summary(bin1)
binsum1
```


##mean of the binomial distribution

```
bin_mean()
```
takes the parameter trials and prob


##variance of the binomial distribution

```
bin_variance()
```
takes the parameter trials and prob


##mode of the binomial distribution

```
bin_mode()
```
takes the parameter trials and prob


##skewness of the binomial distribution

```
bin_skewness()
```
takes the parameter trials and prob


##kurtosis of the binomial distribution

```
bin_kurtosis()
```
takes the parameter trials and prob
